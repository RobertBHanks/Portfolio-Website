      <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Robert Hanks, and for the past nine years I have been a Mathematics Instructor .
        I was recently introduced to coding when my wife decided to change careers, and have been teaching myself recreationally for a few months now.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I have learned so far has been self taught with the help of Mimo and CodeCademy.
        I managed to earn a certificate of completion in Mimo's Web Development course, and am currently about 40% through CodeCademy's Front-End Developer path.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have any major projects under my belt yet - instead I have enjoyed coding challenges found on sites such as <a href="https://www.codewars.com">CodeWars</a>.
        Below you will find some of those challenges I am most proud of.
      </p>
